    "- A **call option** gives the holder the *right* (but not the obligation) to **buy** an asset at a specified price (called the **strike price**) before or at expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: You have the right to buy a stock at 100 dollars even when its price rises to 120 dollars, letting you profit the difference.\n",

    "- A **put option** gives the holder the right to **sell** an asset at the strike price.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If the market price drops to 80 dollars, but your put lets you sell at 100 dollars, you just profited 20 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
